How I adjusted things and why:
- Kept your capsule-render banner because it’s strong branding.
- Added a typing subtitle (readme-typing-svg) to give immediate motion and focus on your student status and specialties.
- Added a layered animated SVG wave under the hero to bring the page to life without heavy GIFs, keeping loading fast and modern.
- Kept the README concise and recruiter-friendly with clear sections: Skills, Education, Projects, Stats, Contact.

What I included for you to commit:
- a polished README.md (this file)
- assets/wave.svg (the animated SVG file referenced above)

If you want, I can commit these files to your repo directly — tell me which branch (e.g., main) and I will push them. Otherwise, copy both files into your profile repo: README.md at repo root and assets/wave.svg under an assets/ folder.
