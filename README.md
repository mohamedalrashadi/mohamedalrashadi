## 💻 Why I Code in Public

I believe the best way to learn is by doing—and sharing that journey with others. Every commit here represents:
- A problem solved
- A concept understood
- A skill improved
- A step closer to becoming a professional developer

**My approach:** Build. Learn. Document. Repeat.
